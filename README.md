# Building my RISC-V CPU Core

Here I'll be saving all of my work while following the [Building a RISC-V CPU Core](https://www.edx.org/course/building-a-risc-v-cpu-core) [EdX](https://edx.org/) course by [Steve Hoover](https://www.linkedin.com/in/steve-hoover-a44b607/) of [Redwood EDA](https://redwoodeda.com), [Linux Foundation](https://www.linuxfoundation.org/), and [RISC-V International](https://riscv.org).

To see the code running, head towards [Makerchip's Official Website](http://makerchip.com/) and Launch the MakerChip IDE or simply just [click here](http://makerchip.com/sandbox/) and paste the code from [RISC-V_Subset_CPU.tlv](RISC-V_Subset_CPU.tlv) or [RISC-V_Complete_CPU.tlv](RISC-V_Complete_CPU.tlv) in the "EDITOR" tab of the IDE. Hit <Ctrl+Enter> to compile. And Enjoy... ;)
